    'Being a self-motivated person with an analytical mind enables me to make reasonable business decisions, dealing deadlines. During my education I covered many fields like Computer Science, Philosophy and International Affairs, which broadened my personal and vocational life perspectives and expertise. Finally,spending my spare time travelling and meeting individuals from all over the world enhanced my communication and teamwork skills significantly, which is crucial to be able to effectively work and collaborate with a diverse team, both culturally and in terms ofexperience. Taking all that into consideration, I believe that my technical skills, experience and passion may result in meaningful cooperation with potential employer. I would like to ask for an opportunity to further discuss the potential for me to join the team as an Entry to Mid Level Web Developer.'
